# A small and simple interpreter for amVy

amVy is a simple language, derived from the Monkey programming language, which was my first source of knowledge for writting this interpreter.
The final objective is to build a 100% stack based, no heap data structure programming language.

## Example

```vY
fn fibonacci(n) {
	if (n < 2) {
		return (1);
	}
	return fibonacci(n - 2) + fibonacci(n - 1);
}

let res = fibonacci(10);
print(res);
```

## Usage

First build the interpreter
```
make
```

Then execute amVy code
```
./amVy mycode.vY
```

Instead of intepreter directly the code, you can only print the outputed AST
```
./amVy mycode.vY --ast
```

For debugging purpose
```
make debug
```
will create an executable that, in case of crash, will print the stack trace of the parser and evaluator.

## TODO

- [ ] support for arrays
- [ ] don't use hashmap OR own hashmap implementation
- [ ] ~ match python3 speed for fibonacci(35)
